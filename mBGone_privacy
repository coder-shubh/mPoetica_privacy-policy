  <h1>Privacy Policy for mBGone</h1>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how mBGone ("the App," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our mobile application, mBGone, which allows users to upload images and remove their backgrounds for free.</p>
  <p>By using the mBGone App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>mBGone is designed with user privacy at its core. We strive to collect only the information necessary to provide our core service of background removal.</p>

  <h3>1.1. Images You Upload</h3>
  <p>The primary function of mBGone involves you uploading images for background removal. When you upload an image:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your image is sent to our third-party background removal service provider for processing.</li>
    <li>The image is processed to remove the background.</li>
    <li>Once the processing is complete and the modified image is returned to your device, neither the original image nor the processed image is stored on our servers or by our service provider. They are immediately deleted after processing.</li>
    <li>We do not access, view, or retain any content from your images beyond what is strictly necessary for the automated background removal process.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2. No Personal Identifiable Information (PII) Collected</h3>
  <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from our users. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, phone number, device identifiers that can be linked to you, or any other information that could identify you personally.</p>

  <h3>1.3. Non-Personal Data / Log Data</h3>
  <p>To help us improve the App's performance and stability, we may collect limited, anonymized, non-personal data (Log Data). This may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address (which is immediately anonymized)</li>
    <li>Device name</li>
    <li>Operating system version</li>
    <li>The configuration of the App when utilizing our service</li>
    <li>The time and date of your use of the service</li>
    <li>Other statistical data used solely for crash reporting and debugging purposes</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>The information we collect (primarily your uploaded images for processing) is used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and maintain the core functionality of the mBGone App</li>
    <li>To analyze and improve the performance, stability, and reliability of the App</li>
    <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties.</p>

  <h3>3.1. Third-Party Service Provider</h3>
  <p>We utilize a third-party API service (currently <a href="http://bgrm.mavesys.com/remove-background" target="_blank">http://bgrm.mavesys.com/remove-background</a>) for the automated background removal process. When you upload an image, it is temporarily transmitted to this service for processing. This service is instructed to not store your images after processing. We have chosen a provider committed to data privacy and security.</p>

  <h3>3.2. Legal Requirements</h3>
  <p>We may disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement or to protect the security or integrity of our service.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>The security of your data is important to us. While no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your uploaded images during transit (e.g., via HTTPS). As your images are not stored on our servers after processing, the risk of long-term data breach related to your images is minimized.</p>

  <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
  <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
